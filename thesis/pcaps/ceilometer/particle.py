'''
A collection of ceilometer-based analysis tools for working with particle information, such as 
fall speed and particle sizes. This can be expanded to more numerical analysis of actual backscatter
information if we desire to gain more information from the analyis.

    This wishes to be a routine that will identify a particular parcel within a 
    specific short period of data, and will then produce a quick trajectory of the
    center of that logically identified parcel.
    
    This is using a lot of programming I am not qualified to be doing...
