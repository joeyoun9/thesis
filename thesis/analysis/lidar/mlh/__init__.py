This will isolate and consolidate all the lidar 
MLH analysis methods into a neater format

from methods import gradient
from methods import idealized as idealized
# from methods import idealized_multiple as idealized_multiple
from methods import threshold as threshold
from methods import ipm as ipm
from methods import variance as variance
from methods import noise_variance as nvariance

# Theoretically all these should now be available
